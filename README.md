# 🌐 DApp Learning from Basic

This project is designed to help beginners learn how to build a **Decentralized Application (DApp)** from the ground up using modern Web3 tools. It starts from basic blockchain concepts and moves towards building and deploying a functional DApp on the Ethereum blockchain.

## 📚 Project Goal

To provide a hands-on, step-by-step learning journey for aspiring Web3 developers. This project includes:

- Smart contract basics with Solidity
- Interaction using Web3.js or Ethers.js
- Frontend with React
- Wallet integration (e.g., MetaMask)
- Deployment on testnets (like Goerli)
